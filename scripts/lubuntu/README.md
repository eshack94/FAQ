### Lubuntu Strip Install Script

Script to strip *bloatware* from Lubuntu.

```
wget -0 strip_install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandleesee/blc/master/scripts/lubuntu/strip_install.sh && sudo bash strip_install.sh
```

Do not remove firefox and gdebi until chrome is downloaded and installed.

Otherwise download chromium-browser. The only flow is that one would be unable to log into the account.
